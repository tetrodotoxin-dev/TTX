// A graph can contain providers that have no native C++ Abstract base. Keeping
// the receiver separate from its operations lets those providers answer from
// their own storage, without allocating an adapter object for every graph
// edge. Consumers traverse the supplied operations instead of depending on
// the language or class that implements the subject.
//
// The supplying boundary establishes the exact Abstract contract before the
// table is used, since an unknown table cannot safely describe how to call
// itself. That agreement includes all six operations, the documentation view,
// and the synchronous visitor. This representation uses the platform C ABI and
// has been exercised on Linux with 64 bit pointers.
//
// The pair borrows its provider so graph owners can manage many views under
// one lifetime. Source is nonnull and identifies the subject for that promised
// lifetime, but retaining the token alone keeps neither state nor code alive.
// The caller retains their lifetime owner, including the providers needed by
// returned handles.
