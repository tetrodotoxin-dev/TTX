# TTX Semantics

This document is the normative contract for implementers of TTX hosts
and semantic objects. Readers evaluating TTX should begin with the
[overview](README.md). The [design document](ttx_design.md) explains the
rationale and tradeoffs behind these rules.

TTX is independent of its host. Concrete languages define their grammar and
type systems. Package, compiler, target, and runtime policy belong to the
systems that consume the resulting graph.

A host conforms by preserving the categories, identity relations, total
queries, and lifetime rules specified here. Conformance does not require one
internal object layout or graph shape.

## Formal model

TTX has two layers:

1. A Lexer maps authored bytes to an ordered Token stream.
2. A consumer interprets those Tokens and may construct shared semantic
   identities and supporting values.

The consumer may construct retained semantic facts directly while reading
Tokens. TTX requires no universal syntax tree between the lexical stream and
the semantic graph.

The semantic graph is live owner state. When a consumer emits an independent
representation, that output is a Terminal product and lies outside the graph.
A later consumer cannot query the output as TTX semantics. It must validate the
format and reconstruct new semantic identities through a graph owner when the
format carries enough facts to support reconstruction.

## Lexical contract

Each Token carries an eight bit `Lexical::Code`, source offset, line, column,
and span size. `Terminal` is `0x00` and `Unknown` is `0xFF`.
Every other Code is interpreted by the exact Lexer and Lexicon contract that
emitted it.

The TTX Tokenizer appends one zero length Terminal at the end of the source. Its
offset equals the source byte count. Another frontend may produce its own Code
stream, including facts established by preprocessing, before constructing the
same Cursor contract. A Cursor can observe a signed relative position without
moving. Observation outside the stream returns an empty Terminal.

A Cursor is the one mutable position over the immutable Token stream. It owns no
tokenization or macro policy. Grammar dispatch proves the selected production
before its parser consumes that Cursor. A rejected production retains its
diagnostics and the source transaction owns discarding any candidate semantic
state.

A source transaction constructs one `Associations` index and supplies it to the
Cursor. A consumer records an authored Anchor with the exact semantic identity
it constructs there. The index retains those borrowed associations after the
mutable Cursor completes, while sharing the source transaction lifetime of the
graph. It creates no semantic edge and cannot be serialized or used after that
graph owner releases the transaction.
When several Anchors contain one source byte, an exact focus Token is more
precise than a containing Span and the narrower range is more precise within
the same class.

`Lexical::Span` identifies a complete authored range. `Lexical::Anchor` pairs
that range with the independent Token a diagnostic should emphasize. An Anchor
created from only a Span focuses its opening Token. A synthetic semantic fact
has no Anchor.

Tokens, Spans, and Anchors measure source in UTF 8 bytes. An editor protocol may
count the same text differently, so its host translates those offsets while it
has the source available. This keeps the authored lexical facts useful to every
host without making editor coordinates part of TTX.

A Code stream is meaningful only with the Lexer contract and source bytes that
produced it. Tokens are decoded source spans, not an independent serialized
program.

### Common categories

TTX defines a common Lexicon for spellings shared by concrete languages. The
Lexicon and semantic interfaces remain separate, so a Token Code never chooses
one universal grammar or semantic result.

A source name for an Addressable uses `snake_case`. A source name for a Type
uses `PascalCase`. Fixed grammar words, modifiers, delimiters, and operators
have dedicated Codes. Attributes use `@name`, byte literals use `0x[...]`, and
embedded resources use `$[...]`.

The lexer preserves common operator spellings as distinct Codes:

| Code            | Spelling |
| --------------- | -------- |
| `AddressOp`     | `.`      |
| `TypeAccessOp`  | `::`     |
| `CallOp`        | `->`     |
| `SwizzleOp`     | `.[`     |
| `ValueAccessOp` | `:[`     |
| `QuestionOp`    | `?`      |

`BracketStart` and `BracketEnd` retain the shared delimiter Codes. A concrete
language may assign different grammar roles to the same delimiter according to
parser context. TTX does not add another lexical spelling for each use.

The Code names do not prescribe a shared expression grammar or result category.
A concrete language assigns grammar and result contracts and proves every TTX
category it consumes.

## Semantic graph

The shared semantic model is a directed graph of Abstract identities. One
identity may be reachable through several local bindings or Alias edges and
therefore has no required parent path.

The closed identity categories are:

* `Abstract` provides identity, a local name, Documentation, category proof,
  one total Type answer, and concept queries.
* `Unknown` is a provisional answer that may settle differently as the graph
  completes.
* `Constant` proves one complete immutable axiomatic graph fact.
* `None` is the shared Constant proving completed absence.
* `Type` provides a semantic domain and one total Layout.
* `Addressable` provides a named address whose total Type edge returns
  `Unknown` while incomplete and one exact Type once established.
* `Callable` provides complete parameter and result Layouts.

Alias carries a required reference through these categories without adding a
category of its own. Every semantic observation forwards to its referent.

`Documentation`, `Layout`, `Pack`, `Interface`, and `Reference` are
supporting contracts and values that carry no semantic identity. Pack carries
named semantic flow over the exact Abstracts identified by its Layout.

These categories are an interchange vocabulary rather than a complete type
system. Concrete languages define their Type inventory, access policy,
mutation, construction, and invocation roles.

A Terminal product is not an identity category. `Lexical::Code::Terminal` is
the end marker for a Token stream. Neither term introduces another semantic
identity.

## Resolution and category proof

Every Abstract exposes its local name, Documentation, represented identity
through `resolve()`, exact Type fact through `get_type()`, and owner-directed
concept lookup through `resolve_concept(name)`. Each observation is total.

`resolve()` returns the represented identity. `resolve_concept(name)` gives one
borrowed binary name to the receiving identity, which interprets the question
according to its own domain. Concrete operators split qualified syntax and ask
the identity selected by each preceding name. They never flatten a qualified
route into one lookup key or encode access and invocation as shared route modes.

`visit_concepts(visitor)` synchronously advertises visible names and their
answers. Native visitors receive Abstract references, while bound visitors
receive foreign-capable Handles through the same navigation agreement. Names
may be temporary during a callback, so consumers copy names they retain or
sort. Abstract values retain their ordinary provider lifetime. The provider
cannot retain the visitor, and the receiver cannot invalidate the traversed
state. Discovery has no semantic order and requires no Pack snapshot.

An incomplete answer returns `Unknown`, never a null graph edge. A completed
unsupported question returns `None`. Later construction may replace an Unknown
answer, but a Constant answer is axiomatic and may be cached permanently.

Category proof establishes the semantic contract of the original object. A
proof never creates a wrapper, clone, registry entry, or substitute identity.
The consumer states the category it needs and either receives that same object
under the proven contract or retains the original Abstract.

Source provenance, declaration structure, visibility, and publication remain
facts of the concrete language owner. Abstract exposes no generic declaration
projection. A consumer that needs those facts proves the concrete owner and
inspects its complete declaration value.

## Unknown, Constant, and None

Unknown is the shared provisional Abstract. Its name is `Unknown`, its
Documentation is empty, and its Type and concept answers remain Unknown. It
stores no failed route, source range, diagnostic, or recovery choice. A query
that answers Unknown may later answer a real identity or None.

Constant proves one complete immutable terminal graph fact. Once any route or
concept resolves to a Constant, that morphism is pure and has one result for the
graph lifetime. A consumer may cache the Constant and return it without
reevaluating the route.

None is the shared Constant for proven absence. Its name is `None`, its Type is
itself, and unsupported concept queries return itself. None never means that a
future answer may materialize; Unknown carries that meaning.

## Alias

Alias provides transparent forwarding to one required referent. It initially
forwards through canonical Unknown and can commit to one exact subject. Name,
documentation, named lookup, synchronous visitation, type questions, semantic
satisfaction, and interface binding all return the referent's answers. Resolve
returns the retained referent. Alias contributes no public Alias interface or
semantic category for a consumer to discover.

Commitment spot-resolves the supplied subject and retains canonical Unknown
or an exact self-resolved subject. None is rejected because absence cannot
fulfill the promise of a referent. Another transparent Alias supplies its
referent, so no Alias chain is retained or traversed through native type tests.
A different exact commitment fails without changing the current referent.
Repeating the same commitment is harmless, while Unknown cannot erase an exact
commitment. The owner retains the referent's lifetime and orders commitment
against queries. Each observation captures one referent and completes through it.

An authored declaration may own a name, documentation, visibility, and a route
recipe. That is a concrete language subject rather than a transparent Alias.
Native declaration linking can retain a reserved Type identity before that
Type's full resolve answer is factual. Consumers must not infer a public Alias
category from the native representation used for that declaration.

Import is an interrogable dependency policy. It resolves to itself, answers
its dependency contract first, and delegates other applicable questions to the
selected export. Asking for the factual imported Type is separate from erasing
the import subject. Lookup and visitation follow the same policy path, and
Pending or Rejected binding answers do not fall through to another provider.

## Type

Type is an Abstract that represents a semantic domain. Once resolution
succeeds, each Type exposes one complete Layout. A Type admitted to ordinary
value flow has at least one Layout entry. A Type with an empty Layout may own
contextual facts, but it cannot be instantiated, produced, or named by an
Addressable. Empty Layouts fit without creating a shared Type identity.

A value Layout terminates when recursively following its real Type entries and
the Types named by its Addressable entries reaches terminal `Value` leaves. An
atomic Type's exact self entry is one such leaf. Returning to an active
structural Type or reaching an empty child Layout is not a complete value
shape. Completion validates this graph property before a concrete language
constructs, lowers, or stores the value.

Every completed concrete Type admitted to ordinary value flow has one total
semantic default. The concrete language owns the
default value and the operation that materializes it. TTX does not infer that
value from an all zero target representation, add a default query to Type, or
require different Types with equivalent defaults to share identity. A semantic
Type selected for contextual traversal remains outside value flow unless a
concrete language operation produces an instance of it.

An empty Layout has no value to default. An empty View is different because it
is one value of the exact View Type and still contributes that Type to its
Pack's Layout.

The identity free terminal `Value` Layout has one entry containing its exact
atomic Type. Atomic identity therefore participates in ordinary Layout fitting
instead of being inferred from an otherwise empty shape. Scalar families,
logical and numeric refinements, bit width, abstract machine storage, and
alignment belong to the concrete language that constructs those Types. They
are not additional host neutral TTX categories.

## Addressable

Addressable is an Abstract that names typed data. Its total `get_type()` query
returns `Unknown` while that edge is incomplete. Once established, it reaches
one exact Type whose Layout contains at least one value. A zero value Type
remains a valid semantic domain, but there is no value whose stable address an
Addressable could name.

A concrete graph object may be Addressable while adding capabilities
owned by its language. TTX defines only the named edge to one Type.

TTX does not make an Addressable forward context, receiver access, or
invocation queries to that Type. A concrete language may add that behavior when
its own receiver model requires it.

Contextual resolution, Layout selection, or another consumer operation may
return an Addressable. TTX does not prescribe its physical address or target
representation, and later realization does not change the selected identity.

Assignment, writability, storage duration, and visibility are concrete language
policy rather than part of the shared Addressable contract.

## Pack

Pack is an identity-free support value that carries one produced semantic flow.
Its Layout identifies the actual producer Abstracts directly. Pack is not an
Abstract, Type, Addressable, or Layout, and it has no parallel Produced record.
A consumer can retain, inspect, fit, or lower the flow without materializing an
aggregate Type or reconstructing a producer table.

A Pack may supply zero, one, or several values. It may expose positional, named,
ranged, or composed output shape. One ordinary value producing expression is
already a one value Pack. Grouping that expression does not create a second
semantic identity. An empty Pack exposes an empty Layout. A concrete language's
empty result and an explicit empty grouping agree through that Layout without
requiring a Type identity. A multiple value Pack remains value flow until a
receiving contract fits it and an owning language deliberately materializes a
Type.

The common delimiter shapes keep value flow and required shape visually
distinct: parentheses group produced Packs while brackets describe Layouts.
Concrete languages decide which productions may omit those delimiters, but
omission does not change the resulting Pack or Layout contract. Named Pack
slots use `.name = expression` and retain those names independently from the
produced semantic objects. Named descriptor slots use `.name : Type`. The
different operator keeps promised shape distinct from supplied value flow.

A Pack is a snapshot value rather than a staged identity. Its owner publishes a
fresh Pack only from facts currently available. Ordered value flow remains
ordered because its owner explicitly supplies an ordered Layout; unordered
concept discovery does not acquire order merely because it is represented by a
Layout value.

## Callable

Callable is an Abstract that supplies one complete signature as a parameter
Layout and a result Layout. TTX assigns no receiver role to any parameter
position or spelling.

TTX does not prescribe how a Callable is selected or invoked. A concrete
language may fit an argument Pack to the parameter Layout and expose the
invocation's result Pack through the result Layout while adding executable body,
calling convention, machine address, or target ABI policy.

## Layout

Layout carries no semantic identity. It describes one promised value shape and
provides ordered observation and directional fitting over exact Abstract
identities. Types and Callables expose required Layouts. Packs carry the Layout
of the values they supply. A consumer may test a complete fit, test a fit
at an offset, and recover the original source edge that supplies a target
position.

The closed fitting errors are `IndexOutOfBounds`, `SizeMismatch`, and
`IncompatibleFit`. A failed fit does not add Unknown to the semantic graph.

TTX defines five common Layout forms:

* `Value` contains one exact atomic Type as the terminal Layout leaf.
* `Fluid` describes ordered positional entries and fits them by represented
  identity. An Addressable target participates through its Type.
* `Named` describes nonempty unique slot names, matches them by name, then
  preserves the fitting rule of the source Layout for each matched entry. A
  slot may borrow its name independently from the source Abstract without
  renaming or wrapping that Abstract.
* `Ranged` describes one exact entry repeated over a fixed interval and applies
  Fluid fitting.
* `Composite` describes two complete Layouts as one shape without flattening
  them.

Fitting is directional: the source supplies the target. Complete fitting
requires equal sizes. Segmented fitting places a source in one target interval.
Successful fitted queries return the original source edge that supplies the
target position. A Layout that decorates or combines another Layout delegates
entry fitting to the source owner rather than replacing its fitting rules.

A consumer may select one exact Layout entry and prove the category required by
its own operation. `Named` provides name based fitting without defining a
universal lookup or member interface.

Layout retains no copied semantic record, target offset, storage class, ABI
rule, or anonymous Type identity. Structural coincidence does not create Type
identity.

An empty Layout has size zero. It fits another empty Layout and describes no
stable value or address, regardless of which concrete Type or Pack exposes it.

## Interface

Pack and Layout describe value flow. A Pack borrows its exact producers, while
its Layout projects that flow into the shape a consumer may receive. This
projection deliberately omits behavior and richer domain meaning.

Interface negotiates the semantic relation that remains after that projection.
It receives two real Abstracts, treats the first as the requirement and the
second as the candidate, and returns `Rejected`, `Satisfied`, or `Equivalent`.
Satisfied is directional. Equivalent is reserved for a relation proved in both
directions by the concrete negotiator.

An Interface may use Layout fitting and shared category proof as evidence, but
matching Layouts alone never imply semantic equivalence. A Callable Interface
can compare parameter and result flow while a richer owner also checks behavior
or policy. Another Interface may negotiate resources, lifecycle roles, or a
domain that carries no value flow.

Interface carries no semantic identity and retains no copied inventory of the
Abstracts it compares. It creates no Alias, wrapper, common Type, or dependency
between their Dialects. The concrete owner selects the negotiator appropriate
to its semantic question.

Interface negotiation creates no runtime representation. A concrete language
may define an explicit erased value that retains an accepted candidate, and a
Terminal may derive the Projection required by its target ABI. Without that value,
the candidate remains concrete and incurs no runtime dispatch merely because an
Interface accepted it.

`Abstract::satisfies(requirement)` is the higher order routing hook used by an
explicit erased value. The concrete candidate owner answers one exact semantic
question without moving its Type system into TTX. The default answer is false.
This query records no relation object and creates no physical Projection.

## Documentation

Documentation carries no semantic identity. It presents an ordered view of
presentation lines. Every Abstract returns one stable Documentation reference.
Missing documentation is the shared empty Documentation value.

Documentation may present one generated line, an ordered authored block, or a
composition of two complete Documentation values. It does not participate in
identity, resolution, or Layout fitting.

An authored `//` line contributes one presentation line. When the comment
payload begins with `/`, the resulting `///` form is a raw comment instead.
Raw comments remain in the lexical source and editor token stream, but they do
not contribute Documentation. Formatting preserves their authored content.

## Reference

Reference is a nonnull borrowed semantic edge. It preserves the exact object
and exposes no absent state.

Reference does not call `resolve()`, follow Alias targets, prove another
category, or canonicalize structurally equal Types. The consumer performs the
operation required by its own contract. This lets a Layout retain the exact
Addressable selected by its owner while a Generic materialization retains the
exact Type selected for one argument.

The graph owner guarantees that the borrowed identity outlives the Reference.
A process address may identify that object while the owner keeps it stable, but
the address is not a durable semantic name. A Reference cannot be serialized or
carried across a Terminal boundary.

## Consumers and Terminal products

Concrete languages may define expressions, constants, generic formulas,
mutation capabilities, receiver roles, executable bodies, and concrete scalar
Types. Their value producing expressions participate as Packs and retain exact
TTX Type, Layout, Addressable, and Callable edges.

Targets may derive sizes, offsets, pointer forms, address spaces, registers,
ABI carriers, and executable addresses. Runtimes may add managed storage,
frames, collectors, and scheduling state. These are consumers of the semantic
graph rather than additional TTX categories.

The completed Workspace is the handoff from raising to Terminal production. A
target producer begins lowering, walks the concrete graphs it supports, and owns
every representation fact it derives. Other producers may project, serialize,
or compose completed facts for their own consumers. No Dialect calls into a
producer, and no product fact becomes a semantic edge.

Dialects and Terminal producers are complementary composition points for the
complete toolchain. Installed Dialects determine which meanings a Workspace can
construct. Selected Terminal producers determine which independent products can
be derived after completion. This parallel role does not give them one shared
interface or lifetime. Dialects participate in the semantic graph, while
Terminal producers consume it from outside.

A consumer crosses the Terminal boundary when it emits an output whose
consumption is independent of the live semantic graph and its identities.
Formatted text, editor data, LLVM IR, SPIR-V modules, debug data, object
modules, executables, and semantic archives are examples. Terminal is a
boundary role. TTX defines no universal Terminal category, product registry,
or common byte container.

Each Terminal format belongs to its concrete producer. The format may retain
source presentation, target representation, or reconstruction facts defined by
semantic owners according to that producer's purpose. The Terminal itself is
never an Abstract, Type, Pack, Layout, Addressable, Callable, or Reference.

A target Terminal such as LLVM IR or an object module does not become a
semantic source of truth. Target Types, offsets, registers, address spaces,
calling convention records, and pointer representations remain derived facts
owned by that compilation. They are not copied back into the graph.

Terminal is relative to the live Workspace. An LLVM module or emitted MLIR
module may be Terminal for Tetrodotoxin while remaining an intermediate input
to another tool's progressive lowering pipeline.

A semantic Terminal may support reconstruction without source. Its reader first
validates the complete bounded format. A graph owner then creates new stable
identities, reconnects edges as defined by their owners, and applies its own
validation, completion, and publication contract.

Reconstruction is equivalent when the fresh graph reproduces every public
observation promised by the format. These observations may include names,
categories, represented identity relations, semantic edges, order, Layout
behavior, completion, and concrete owner facts. Equivalence does not require
the same internal graph shape, process addresses, or References.

The Terminal producer defines that observation set. It may retain only the
Types, Addressables, Callables, constant Pack flow, and owner facts that later
consumers can query through its contract. Source declarations, executable
bodies, and intermediate expressions are not implied observations. A compiled
Package may therefore pair a semantic Terminal that reconstructs its query
surface with a native Terminal that supplies execution. Recompilation remains
a source or live Workspace operation.

Structural coincidence is never enough for reconstruction. A reader cannot
infer Type identity from matching Layouts, recover owner relations from target
offsets, or treat a Terminal Type as the original semantic Type.

## Semantic invariants

1. Every emitted Token has one Code and one source span.
2. A Token stream is interpreted with the Lexer contract and source bytes that
   produced it.
3. Unrecognized authored bytes emit `Unknown` rather than disappearing.
4. Every semantic identity is an Abstract.
5. Incomplete semantic queries return Unknown, while completed absence returns
   None; neither answer is a null edge.
6. Later construction never changes an identity already returned successfully.
7. Alias transparently forwards to one required, spot-resolved referent and
   cannot replace an exact commitment.
8. TTX Type and Addressable impose no Static or Self receiver routing policy.
9. An atomic Type exposes itself as one terminal `Value` Layout entry.
   Every Type admitted to value flow has a nonempty Layout, Addressable reaches
   one such Type, and Callable supplies complete parameter and result Layouts.
10. Pack is an identity-free support value whose Layout names the actual
    producers directly.
11. Type, Addressable, Callable, Pack, Layout, and Interface remain independent
    contracts. TTX defines no universal member model over them.
12. Layout owns promised shape, order, and directional fitting, not produced
    value identity or copied semantic or physical
    records.
13. Interface negotiates a semantic relation over real Abstracts without
    creating identity, copying either graph, or making equal Layouts imply
    equal meaning.
14. Every completed concrete Type admitted to ordinary value flow has one
    language owned semantic default. TTX neither derives it from target bits
    nor makes it a shared identity or Type query.
15. Concrete language, package, target, runtime, and diagnostic policy remain
    outside TTX.
16. Reference preserves one exact borrowed object and never resolves or
    canonicalizes it implicitly.
17. A Reference is valid only within the lifetime guaranteed by its graph
    owner and never crosses a Terminal boundary.
18. A Terminal product is outside the semantic graph and belongs to no TTX
    identity category.
19. Target facts specific to a Terminal never flow backward into the graph as
    semantic authority.
20. Reconstruction without source creates a new live graph through its graph
    owner and never restores process addresses.
21. A reconstructed graph is published only after the graph owner's complete
    validation, completion, and publication contract succeeds.
